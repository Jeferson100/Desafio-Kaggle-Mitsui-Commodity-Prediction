# MITSUI & CO. Commodity Prediction Challenge

This project is my submission for the [MITSUI & CO. Commodity Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mitsui-commodity-prediction-challenge/overview) on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to develop a model that can accurately forecast the future prices of various commodities.
